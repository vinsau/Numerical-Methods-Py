# Numerical-Methods-Py  

This repository contains implementations of various numerical methods for solving equations. Each method is organized into its respective folder.  

## Included Methods  

- **Bisection Method** – Root-finding method using interval halving.  
- **Newton-Raphson Method** – A fast convergence method using derivatives.  
- **Regula-Falsi Method** – A bracketing method similar to bisection but with better accuracy.  
- **Secant Method** – A derivative-free alternative to Newton-Raphson.  

## Requirements  

Python 3 is required to run the scripts. Some methods may require additional libraries.  

### Special Note  
The script **`AD-newton_raphson.py`** inside the **Newton-Raphson-Method** folder requires the **Autograd** library. Install it using:  

```bash
pip install autograd
```

## Usage  

Each folder contains a script demonstrating the respective numerical method. Run the scripts using Python:  

```bash
python script_name.py
```
